# Project 2 - Crowdfunding_ETL - Group 3

- Ajani Oldacre
- Lina Orjuela

This is a mini ETL project, to be worked on in groups of 2 partners, to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, four CSV files are created and the data from the CSV file is used to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the data from the CSV file is loaded into a Postgres database.

### In this Jupyter notebook file "ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_Aoldacre_Lorjuela.ipynb" you will find:

- Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
- Create the Campaign DataFrame
- Create the Contacts DataFrame
- Create the Crowdfunding Database

## Under Resources, you will find
- contacts.xlsx
- crowdfunding.xlsx
- category.csv
- subcategory.csv
- contacts.csv
- campaign.csv
  
## You will also find the files related to the creation of the Postgres Database "Crowdfunding"
- **QuickDBD-export:** contains the sketch of an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD 
- **crowdfunding_db_schema.sql:** contains a database schema with table schema for each CSV file from the ERD 
- **crowdfunding_db:** Postgres database
